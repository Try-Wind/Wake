# Contributing to Wake

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wake! We welcome contributions from the hardware and embedded systems community.

## üéØ Our Focus

Wake is a hardware-first coding agent. We're particularly interested in contributions that:

- Improve hardware debugging capabilities
- Add support for new microcontrollers and development boards
- Enhance driver generation from datasheets
- Add new hardware communication protocols
- Improve embedded systems tooling
- Add IoT and robotics features

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Try-Wind/Wake.git
   cd Wake
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test
   ```

3. **Create a branch for your feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Development Process

### Before You Start

- Check existing issues and pull requests
- Open an issue to discuss major changes
- For hardware-specific features, provide context about the use case

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for hardware-specific logic
- Include examples for hardware features

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Test with actual hardware when possible
- Document hardware requirements for tests
- Run `cargo test` before submitting

## üîß Areas We Need Help

### High Priority

- **Datasheet Parser**: Improve OCR and parsing of hardware datasheets
- **Protocol Analyzers**: Add support for more communication protocols
- **Board Support**: Add templates for popular development boards
- **Driver Templates**: Expand driver generation templates

### Medium Priority

- **Documentation**: Hardware examples and tutorials
- **Testing**: Hardware simulation and testing frameworks
- **UI/UX**: Improve terminal interface for hardware debugging
- **Performance**: Optimize for embedded development workflows

### Always Welcome

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage
- Performance optimizations

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for new features
2. **Add tests** for your changes
3. **Run all tests** locally: `cargo test`
4. **Update the README** if needed
5. **Submit PR** with clear description
